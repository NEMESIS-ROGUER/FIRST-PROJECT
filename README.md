# FIRST-PROJECT
This project is based on the Rossmann Store Sales Kaggle competition, where the goal is to build a predictive model that forecasts daily sales for over 1,000 Rossmann drugstores across Germany. The task involves analyzing historical sales data, understanding promotional effects, handling missing values, and applying machine learning.
